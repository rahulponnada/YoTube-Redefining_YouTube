# YoTub-Redefining_YouTube
A new way to seach YouTube by topics (ontological terms) there by enhancing your searching experience.

Everyday it is estimated that there are humongous number of videos are being uploaded to youtube. Almost 300 minutes of video is uploaded to youtube per minute. To search a video in this large database is sometimes a tedious. In this project we addressed the problem by using utilizing Freebase API and YouTube data analytics API to rank the videos and narrow down your search results according to topics.

Freebase API has provided us with Ontological terms to narrow down the search results according to the topic selected by the user. YouTube data analytics API has provided the metadata of the video which helped us to rank the video based on certain factors.

Following are the factors used to rank a video.
1. High View Count percentage
2. High Like/ViewCoutn percentage
3. Low Dislike/Like percantage
4. High Comment Count

Computing these values will ultimately give us a rank to sort the videos accordingly. We believe this application can help anyone to search videos faster with perfect results.
